# Hi 🙋‍♂️ I’m Justin

I love building data-driven applications and exploring the intersection of AI/ML and full-stack development. Whether it's designing a predictive model, building a web interface, or integrating a database — I enjoy projects that let me solve real problems with code, and learn new technologies along the way.
